# General Project Objectives

This document outlines the overarching goals and principles guiding the development of the Pokémon Generator application.

## Core Objectives

1.  **Immersive Generation Experience**: Provide users with a fun and engaging way to generate unique Pokémon via a text-to-image service.
2.  **User Autonomy & Offline Resilience**: Empower users with full control over their Pokémon collection and token balance, ensuring all data is saved locally for seamless offline functionality.
3.  **Balanced In-App Economy**: Implement a clear, fair, and transparent token system that encourages continuous interaction through creation and resource management.
4.  **Intuitive & Aesthetic User Interface**: Design a visually appealing, responsive, and easy-to-use interface that aligns with modern web standards and provides a delightful user experience.
5.  **Robust API Integration**: Reliably connect with the external Pokémon generation API, handling authentication, data processing, and error conditions gracefully.

## Key Principles

*   **Client-Side Focus**: Maximize client-side processing and storage to reduce server dependencies and enhance performance.
*   **Accessibility**: Ensure the application is usable by a wide range of users, adhering to accessibility best practices.
*   **Performance**: Optimize for fast loading times and smooth interactions.
*   **Maintainability**: Write clean, readable, and well-organized code following established coding guidelines.
*   **Security (Client-Side)**: Protect sensitive client-side data (like API keys) through appropriate practices.
