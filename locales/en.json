Quick flips (reselling a fresh Minimon in under 5 seconds while it still shows “New!”) add extra score, while repeating the same rarity lowers the refund slightly to keep the market fresh. Treat every session like a seasonal ladder-learn, iterate, and keep the lab lights on.",

Smash “Start New Game”, craft your dream lineup, then flood social networks with your best Minimon decks while quoting “P2Enjoy” so the whole community knows who’s setting the pace.
